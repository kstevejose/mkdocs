Right join is similar to Left join and does the exact opposite of what LEFT JOIN does. RIGHT JOIN returns all the rows from the RIGHT table and matches them with all the rows in the LEFT table. If there are matching records, it displays the output. If no matching records are found, it displays NULL.

 RIGHT JOINS are used when you need all the rows from the right table even if there are no matching records in the left table.

**RIGHT JOIN** syntax:
```sql
SELECT table_1.column_1, table_2.column_1 FROM table 1 RIGHT JOIN table 2 ON table_1.column_2 = table_2.column_2;
```
Letâ€™s consider this example in the following table:

Table **Employees**

|  employee_id | employee_name | department_id |
|----------|----------|------|
| 1 | Tony | 100| 
| 2| Silvio | 101| 
| 3 | Paulie | 102 | 
| 4 | Bobby | 103 | 

Table **Departments**

|  department_id | department_name | 
|----------|----------|
| 100 | Boss | 
| 101| Consigliere | 
| 102| Under Boss | 
|104|Soldier|

In this example, if we would like to find all the departments and their employees even for those departments that do not have any employees, we can execute a RIGHT JOIN as follows:

```sql
SELECT e.employee_name, d.department_name FROM employees e RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**Output**:

|  employee_name | department_name | 
|----------|----------|
| Tony | Boss | 
| Silvio| Consigliere | 
| Paulie| Under Boss | 
| NULL| Soldier|
